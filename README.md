# Stock Prediction - Machine Learning App
This project uses support vector regression to predict the best model to use to fit the stock prices dataset.


Th output, as always, is in the PNG file, and it is very obvious that RBF is indeed the best model for stock prices. The python file also has a predict function, that got to 90% accuracy when tested!
